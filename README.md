#Unity DLL Assignment

For this module I was tasked with creating a managed plug in DLL (Dynamic Link Library) that can be integrated into a Unity project. The DLL should handle spawning collectibles, spawning enemies, a scoring system and a game manager.

Then I was tasked with creating a tech demo Unity project that showcased the DLL and had its own separate criteria for the Unity project.
